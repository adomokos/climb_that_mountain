### [Simple & Beautiful Rails Code with Functional Style](http://www.adomokos.com/2013/01/simple-beautiful-rails-code-with.html)

In early October I submitted this abstract to [CodeMash](http://www.codemash.org/):

"Do you have to look at Rails models with 1400 lines of code? Or 80 line method loaded with iterators, conditionals and instance variables? Not only you, even the code author does not understand what's going on in there.

I'll show you how you can craft simple and beautiful Rails application by adopting functional programming inspired ideas. Say goodbye to the mess you have by constructing tiny classes and functions that you can use to build up a complex system."

My talk got accepted and I gave it in early January, 2013. In case you could not attend it, or if you want to review the slides again, here is an abridged version of it.

_Viewing the HTML and CSS behind the presentation reveals that this is a Bootstrap Carousel with images (likely extracted from PowerPoint or similar tool). [Bootstrap Carousel](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel)_

_may I know what text editor you're using? If Sublime Text, what color scheme is that? Thanks. Beautiful code you got there._

_@Charlie: In the slides I used the great `pygmentize` gem (https://github.com/djanowski/pygmentize). My choice of code editor is vim and I used the "slate" color (https://github.com/adomokos/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/.vimrc#L51)._
