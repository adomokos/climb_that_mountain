### [Simple and Elegant Rails Code with Functional Style - RailsConf 2013 Talk](http://www.adomokos.com/2013/06/simple-and-elegant-rails-code-with.html)

I was very excited to talk about my beliefs on simple and elegant software at [Rails Conf 2013](http://www.railsconf.com/) earlier this May. [Confreaks](http://confreaks.com/events/railsconf2013) recorded all the talks and lightning talks.

[Here is mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glU_I3Xiooc). Enjoy!
