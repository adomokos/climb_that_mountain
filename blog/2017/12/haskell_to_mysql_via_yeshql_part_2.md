### Haskell to MySQL via Yeshql (Part 2.)

In the [previous](blog/2017/11/haskell_to_mysql_via_yeshql.md) blog post we built the skeleton of a console app in Haskell that talks to MySQL via Yeshql. We used a Makefile to rebuild the database, compile the code and run the app. [This is](https://github.com/adomokos/hashmir/commit/78a597e2c348abe751178812367f260fde69edb6) the commit point where we left it at the end of Part 1.
