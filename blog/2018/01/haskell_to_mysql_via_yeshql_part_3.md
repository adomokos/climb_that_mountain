### Haskell to MySQL via YeshQL (Part 3.)


In the [previous](/blog/2017/12/haskell_to_mysql_via_yeshql_part_2.md) blog post we built a console app in Haskell that talks to MySQL via [YeshQL](https://github.com/tdammers/yeshql). It create a client record and counted that records with a SQL query. [This is](https://github.com/adomokos/hashmir/commit/275d45ad1f6abe1f6f5eccb0e67c552543c96c90) the commit point where we left it at the end of Part 2.

#### Add Tests

Let's set up the testing tool [HSpec](some_link_to_hspec) in our project.
