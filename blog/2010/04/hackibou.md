### [Hackibou](http://www.adomokos.com/2010/04/hackibou.html)

It all started a couple of weeks ago when I suggested to [@pragmaticpat](http://twitter.com/pragmaticpat) that we should get together for a little BDD with RSpec in Ruby. I have always wanted to work on the [Roman Numerals ruby quiz](http://rubyquiz.com/quiz22.html) that I found in the book "Best Ruby Quiz", I thought this could be a pretty good chance of trying it. Set up the place (Caribou - hence the name Hackibou), date and time and we were ready to do it. A couple of days before the date I tweeted about it. Word got out and two great guys ([@joelhelbling](http://twitter.com/joelhelbling) and [@johnwesp](http://twitter.com/johnwesp)) decided to join us.

We had three hours to work on this quiz. I got a latte, asked a lady to give up the table she used, set up a blank project with [@pragmaticpat](http://twitter.com/pragmaticpat) and we started coding. We did two 45 minutes sessions in the afternoon. We discussed what we did and switched pairs after the first session. We intentionally kept the code we wrote and tried to build on top of that in the second session. Unfortunately we did not finish the quiz. Joel took it the farthest, he worked on it at the end of the day. You can see his code on [github](http://is.gd/bGGBA).

All in all, we all had a great time.

At the end of our session Joel did a quick demo on [jspec](http://visionmedia.github.com/jspec/) with JavaScript. It seems really cool, I have to give it a try soon.

I hope Hackibou won't be a one time event. I am planning on organizing one in 2-3 weeks. I hope to see you there!

This was really a lot of fun. Not sure I'll be able to be in Cleveland for the next one, but I would really love to see this continue.

BTW, this was (as far as I know) the second occasion to carry the "Hackibou" name. @robpark and I attended what I believe to be the first such event during the week before the Cleveland event (Hackibou CBS 2010). I have a twitter direct message to Rob which proves this, but alas, I did not announce it to the world. Perhaps this means that the Cleveland event was, in fact, a world-wide first: Open Hackibou CLE 2010\.

I like saying that: HackibouCle. Try it for yourself (but don't just say it, attend the next one!).
